# What is this?

This is a more challenging PvE mod for [Coopordie](http://www.coopordie.com/quake2/).

I pulled coopordie v10.04 from [its SVN](https://sourceforge.net/p/coopordiequake2/code/HEAD/tree/) and made it work on my Windows 10 machine running Visual Studio 2019.

# I can't run it. Help!

Good luck. C++ has always been a PITA for me to get working ðŸ˜…. 

I'm very satisfied that the code finally compiles now on my PC.

# I want to contribute / I have a really cool idea

Feel free to open up an issue or DM me if you can.
